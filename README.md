# Brightspot Local Installation Tool

This is the Bash version of the install script. Server organization is slightly different from the Ant version, but it's just as easy to use!

The autogenerated directory structure is as follows

                    |Main Project Directory|
                   /                        \
                  /                          \ 
      |Brightspot Project|            |Tomcat Directory|

## Minimum Requirements
* UNIX-based operating system (i.e. OSX/macOS, Linux)
* Bash 3.2 or greater (`bash --version` to check)
* MySQL 5.6.* or greater (must be running when executing install script). Make sure MySQL is on your PATH
* [GNU Wget 1.18](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), can be found using `apt-get install wget` on most Linux flavors, `brew install wget` on [Homebrew for macOS](https://brew.sh/), or through download links

## Installation
For macOS users, an option to install via Homebrew is available. Simply execute `brew install p-easterbrooks/brightspot-initializer/bsit`

If you choose to not use Homebrew or are on a Linux machine, download the release files and move 'blit' to a directory where you normally execute scripts from (i.e. '/usr/local/bin')
After downloading, create a `bin` directory in your home directory if it does not already exist and copy the `bsp-install` script to `~/bin` and add `~/bin:$PATH`to your path in your `~/.bash_profile`. Alternatively, you may add the script to any other directory you use executable scripts.

## Using the Installer
From the directory you typically install Brightspot projects in, run `bsp-install` and follow the prompts. The script will download and configure all necessary resources.
